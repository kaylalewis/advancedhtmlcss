### Site Deployment
Once you're ready to put your site online, it's best to go through and make sure it's in an optimal state for navigation.

<br>

### Search Engine Optimization
SEO is the practice of making your site more noticeable upon search. This is as easy as including keywords throughout the content in your site.
<br>

* It helps to write down words that would trigger a search to pull up your site, and incorporate them into the copy of your site.

* Images with text baked into them will not help with SEO, so it is best practice to add a caption or alt text to the html itself.

* Sites that are constantly updated also have higher chances of appearing early in a search.

<br>

### Usability
General usability of a site is harder to achieve than you might think. Even professionals are aware of this, since something like the copy of a button can dramatically affect the amount of people who choose to buy something on a site. That's why, instead of the "all-knowing" approach, many website makers use testing.

<br>

**A/B** testing includes alternate forms of parts of a site or entire pages that load randomly. Google Analytics has a tool that can measure activity based off the different page views, which allows you to see the preferred experience.

<br>
If A/B testing seems a little tedious, sit down with a friend or someone at a coffeeshop and let them navigate your site. Any feedback is valuable feedback! It's easy to miss things when you are the one building the site.
<br>
Think about your content as telling a story. What will lead a person to get from one place to another? The user is in dialogue with your site. Is it easy to converse?

### Hosting

Hosting should've been made familiar to you in previous classes. There are a ton of ways to get a website out there:
