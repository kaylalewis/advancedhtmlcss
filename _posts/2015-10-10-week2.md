<div id = "week2" class="anchor"></div>

#### HTML Tags 
* Code block 


        <code>
        <p>This will show up as code, with the p tags</p>
        </code>

* Video 


        <video width="800" height="600" controls>
        <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Not supported in browser
        </video> 

<br> 

#### CSS Inheritance 
* Depends heavily on HTML structure of page
* Can use selectors like ids (used once) and classes (reusable):

        <p id="cat">Apply id 'cat'</p>
        <p class="dog">Apply class 'dog'</p>


* Goes by parent-child relationships: 

        <body>
        <article>
        <h1>Heading</h1>
        <p>Paragraph words.</p>
        </article>
        </body> 

Body is the parent of article, article is the parent of heading and paragraph. Heading is the first child of article, and paragraph is the second child of article.
<br>
  
* Certain CSS properties don't translate to children (e.g. padding or borders won't auto cascade to all of the elements within the body, for obvious reasons) 

<br> 

* CSS gives the ability to select very specific combinations of elements. Some useful syntax includes 

    * div p – all p's that are inside divs
    * div > p – all p's that are children of div
    * div, p – selects both div and p elements
    * p:first-child – 
    * p:nth-child(2)
    * p:nth-last-child(2)
    * p::first-line
    * p:first-of-type
