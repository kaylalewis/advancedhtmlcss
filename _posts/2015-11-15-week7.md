Forms come up in many websites. They can either be an easy experience for the user, or a complete nightmare.
<br>
Spacing, copy, and overall appearance have huge impacts on forms.
<br>

#### Forms
Some common input types include

  * Radio
  * Text
  * Button
  * Checkbox
  * Number

<br>

Text areas and 'select' from a list of items are also used often.
<br>
Put elements within a form tag, including the submit button. This will allow for action once submitting the form (e.g. send to server, send to email).

#### Navigation
Although we've talked a lot about site structures that will lead to a more enjoyable user experience, there are also some quick ways to build off that.

### Back button

        $(".back").click(function(){
          window.history.back();
        });

Conversely, you can do the same thing with

        window.history.forward();

If there is no forward history, the link will be null.

### jQuery toggle nav dropdown
We mentioned toggling buttons last week, but here is the code to go along with the demo where we will toggle subsets of a navigation menu:

        $("#topicsList").hide();
        $("#topics").click(function(){

        $( "#topicsList" ).toggle();}

        );
