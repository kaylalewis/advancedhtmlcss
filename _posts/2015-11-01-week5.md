####jQuery

jQuery (whose motto is “write less, do more”) is a JavaScript library that avoids the tedious structure of JavaScript by condensing syntax and providing quick solutions to a multitude of JavaScript-related tasks.

[Download jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/)

You write jquery statements like sentences. They have a subject and actions that happen in the order they're listed.

Basic syntax

        $('h2').show();

jQuery relies on the use of CSS selectors to call out elements.

"The list adds a class."

        $('li').addClass('red');


"The h1 element is clicked and then hidden."

        $('h1').click(function(){

            $(this).hide();
        });


Events are actions that trigger a function, like 'click' or 'mouseleave'
