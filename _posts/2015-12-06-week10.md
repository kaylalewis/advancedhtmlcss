***If you don't practice, you won't get better...building up your portfolio is also really, really important.***

* Talk to your favorite non-profit about redesigning a website as a volunteer project if you feel like you aren't ready to do paid work (or if you're feeling generous...)
* Family and friends often have projects that could use a website.
* Sites like craigslist are great to find paying clients. Just look for freelance web design/developer jobs.
