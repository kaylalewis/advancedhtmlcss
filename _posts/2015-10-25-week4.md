#### Scaling Sites

With the variety of devices we use to browse websites, it's important to be aware of the appearance of your sites on multiple platforms. There are numerous ways to build sites that reconfigure based on screen size.

Responsive websites create fluidity based off percentages; adaptive sites have fixed dimensions that they adhere to (and oftentimes the content is presented in a strategically different way)

<img src = "{{ site.baseurl }}/../screens.png">
<img src = "{{ site.baseurl }}/../iphone.jpg">
